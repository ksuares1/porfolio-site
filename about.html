        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>I have always been fascinated with how things work and finding solutions to complex problems. 
                    Becoming an engineer would allow me to combine my love for math and science with my passion 
                    for innovation and creativity. 
                    I believe that pursuing a career in engineering will provide me with the
                    opportunity to make a positive impact on the world by 
                    developing new technologies and improving existing systems.
                </p>
            
                <p>Furthermore engineering offers a diverse range of opportunities for specialization, 
                    from mechanical and civil engineering to computer and electrical engineering. 
                    This allows me to explore potentially specialize in an area that aligns with my interests and strengths.
                    I am particularly drawn to the idea of working in sustainable engineering, where I can utilize my skills to contribute
                    to creating environmentally friendly solutions to pressing global issues.
                </p>
            
                <p>In addition, the prospect of continuous learning and growth as an engineer is particularly appealing to me. 
                    The field is constantly evolving with new technologies and innovations emerging, providing endless opportunities 
                    for personal and professional development.I am excited about the prospect of challenging myself and pushing
                    the boundaries of what is possible through engineering. Ultimately, becoming an engineer would not 
                    only fulfill my ambition but also allow me to make a positive impact on the world through
                    innovation and problem solving.
